## Inspiration

The idea arose after noticing the high rate of insecurity in public and private transportation, especially during night rides.  
Many passengers, especially women and students, have faced dangerous situations without being able to call for help in time.

Your Safe Taxi was created to offer a tool that reacts quickly, alerts instantly, and protects users.  
"The goal is to make safety a right, not a privilege."
